# FAQ Module

## Overview
The FAQ module provides structured answers to common questions users or developers may have when working with the Expo Firebase Boilerplate. Its purpose is to reduce onboarding friction, clarify typical integration points, and help resolve recurring issues within the system.

## Key Features
- **Frequently Asked Questions Repository**: Centralizes answers to common queries about setup, configuration, and usage.
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Offers guidance for resolving frequent issues encountered during development or deployment.
- **Integration References**: Directs users to key parts of the boilerplate system, such as Firebase setup, Expo configuration, or key workflows.

## System Errors
It's important to document common errors and troubleshooting steps:
- **Configuration Error**: Incorrect or incomplete Firebase or Expo configuration.  
  **Resolution**: Verify API keys, config files, and that all required environment variables are set.
- **Dependency Mismatch**: Version conflicts between Expo, Firebase, or other required packages.  
  **Resolution**: Consult the documentation for required versions and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to align dependencies.

## Usage Examples
Practical code examples showing how to use the module:

```markdown
## How do I configure Firebase in my Expo project?
Follow the Firebase setup guide in the documentation, ensuring you add your configuration to the appropriate file and install necessary dependencies.

## What should I do if the app fails to connect to Firebase?
Double-check your Firebase credentials, ensure your device/network is online, and verify configuration files for typos.
```
